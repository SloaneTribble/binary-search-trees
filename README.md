# binary-search-trees

This Odin Project assignment focuses on implementing balanced binary search trees.  A function takes an array of random numbers, sorts the array, and uses the array's values to create a balanced binary search tree.

There are different functions for printing a tree's elements in level order, preorder, postorder, and inorder. 

There is also a function to traverse an unbalanced tree and use its values to return a balanced tree.
