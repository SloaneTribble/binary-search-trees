# binary-search-trees

This Odin Project assignment focuses on implementing balanced binary search trees.  A function takes an array of random numbers, sorts the array, and uses the array's values to create a balanced binary search tree.

This program includes functions for:

- Printing a tree's elements in level order, preorder, postorder, and inorder

- Checking whether a tree is balanced

- Traversing an unbalanced tree and use its values to return a balanced tree 

- Inserting, deleting, and searching for values

- Checking height and depth of a given node
